Rock the party
Listen to the magic
While the magic ain't mysterious
Cast the magic
Rock the party with the magic
Listen to the magic

Music is everything
Build music up
Yesterday is nothing
Today is everything
Build today up
The hype is everything

While today is lower than the party
Let yesterday be today without music
Let the present be the party at today
Let the memory be the party at yesterday
Build today up
If the present is higher than the memory
Build the hype up


Shout the hype
