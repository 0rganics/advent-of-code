# advent-of-code
Here lie my attempts at the Advent of Code, in the Rockstar programming language.

I'm starting this in November 2021, likely going to attempt some of the 2020 puzzles as practice before taking on 2021's in real time.

If you want to test any of my code, I suggest this interpreter.
